# Course Registration System
The aim of this project is to design and develop a class registration system that allows students to register
for seats in a class where the order of priority for registration depends on the student’s grade level. It
also facilitates the organization of students within the class based on alphabetical order. A wait-list will be
included so that if a class is full, students will join a wait-list based on who joined it first. If a seat opens
up, it will be filled by the wait-listed student first in line. The system will solve the problem of student
registration and overfilling a course, which will improve the efficiency and student experience
### The project’s main objectives are:
- To allow students to efficiently register for courses.
- Have an easy-to-use menu interface
- Create a process for randomly filling seats for user simulation
- Record student and course information
- Use randomization to simulate the real world course registration systems.

The expected outcomes include a functioning C++ based program, proper documentation, and a final project
report.

## How to run program
The final code is located in main.cpp and so it can be imported into any c++ ide and be run from there.
