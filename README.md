# Course-Registration-System
This project is a course registration system that allows students to register for a course. The order in which students register is based on their grade level, starting with the highest and moving down. There will be a system implemented that allows students to join a waitlist for a course when it is full. If a seat opens up, a student will be moved from the waitlist to the course based on who was in the waitlist first. Once a course is full, for ease of access, the students will be organized in a course list in alphabetical order.
